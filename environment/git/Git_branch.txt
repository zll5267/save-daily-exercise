Branching mode "killer feature"
1 Create Branch
  git branch <name>
2 Change the current Branch
  git checkout <branchName>
  git checkout <branchName> #create a branch and switch to the new branch.
  
  git merge <branchName> # merge the changes on  <branchName> to the current branch you are work on
  
  Fast forwar merge:the commit pointed to by the branch you merged in was directly upstream of the commit you're on.
  Three-way merge: Using the two snapshot pointed to by the branch tips and the common ancestor of the two.

  Merge conflict:
  git status # to see the unmerged file due to merge conflicts
  
  git mergetool
  the conflict is divided by ===,about it is the content from the branch you are on.the below content is from the merge-in branch.
2 Branch Management
  list the branchs in the repository
  git branch # no arguments
  git branch -v # to see the last commit on each branch
  
  git branch --merged
  git branch --no-merged
