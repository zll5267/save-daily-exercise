Branching mode "killer feature"
1 Create Branch
  git branch <name>
2 Change the current Branch
  git checkout <branchName>
  git checkout <branchName> #create a branch and switch to the new branch.
  
  git merge <branchName> # merge the changes on  <branchName> to the current branch you are work on
  
  Fast forwar merge:the commit pointed to by the branch you merged in was directly upstream of the commit you're on.
  Three-way merge: Using the two snapshot pointed to by the branch tips and the common ancestor of the two.

  Merge conflict:
  git status # to see the unmerged file due to merge conflicts
  
  git mergetool
  the conflict is divided by ===,about it is the content from the branch you are on.the below content is from the merge-in branch.
Branch Management
  list the branchs in the repository
  git branch # no arguments
  git branch -v # to see the last commit on each branch
  
  git branch --merged
  git branch --no-merged# to see the branchs which contain work that isn't merged in.
  
Branch Workflow 
  master: stable,only code that has been or will be released.
  develop: not stable, still under development.
  topic: a short-lived branchs, use to fix bugs

Remote Branch
  Remote branches are references to the state of branches on your remote repositories.
  They're local branches that you can't move;they're moved automatically whenever you do
  any network communication.
  Remote branches act as bookmarks to remind where the branches on your remote rempositories
  were the last time you connected to them.
  the FORM: (remote)/(branch)
  git remote add <remoteName> <URL>
  git fetch <remoteName> # looks up remote server <remoteName>,fetchs any data from it that you don't have yet.
                         # update the local database,move the <remoteName>/master to the new one.
